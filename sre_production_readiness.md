# SRE Production Readiness Review (PRR)

```yaml
name: sre_production_readiness
label: "Production Readiness"
description: >
  Comprehensive checklist and template for ensuring services are ready
  for production-grade traffic and on-call support.

prr_checklist:
  observability:
    - "Are the Four Golden Signals (Latency, Errors, Traffic, Saturation) monitored?"
    - "Is there a dashboard for this service in the central monitoring system?"
    - "Are SLOs defined and agreed upon by stakeholders?"
    - "Does the service have distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) implemented?"
  alerting:
    - "Are alerts symptom-based rather than cause-based?"
    - "Is there a runbook for every alert that can page a human?"
    - "Are alert routing and escalation paths verified?"
  reliability:
    - "Has the service been load tested to 2x expected peak?"
    - "Is there a graceful degradation/failover plan for all dependencies?"
    - "Has a Chaos experiment (e.g., Pod Kill) been performed in staging?"
    - "Is the service deployed across at least two Availability Zones?"
  operations:
    - "Is there an automated rollback mechanism?"
    - "Is the service configuration version-controlled and auditable?"
    - "Is there a documented process for database migrations?"
    - "Has an on-call rotation been established and staffed?"
